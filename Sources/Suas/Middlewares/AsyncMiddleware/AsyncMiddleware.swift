/// Async action this type of action is intercepted by `AsyncMiddleware` and is not dispatched to the reducer
///
/// Recepie to use `AsyncAction`
/// 1. Create an `AsyncAction` action
/// 2. In the block passed at init. Perform any operation (dispatching it on your queue)
/// 3. When result is ready, call `dispatch` passing a new action
/// --------
/// **Example:**
///
/// Performing an async loading from disk
///
/// ```
/// let action = AsyncAction { (dispatch) in
///   DispatchQueue(label: "MyQueue").async {
///     // Load from disk
///     // Process loaded
///     // Do more work
///
///     // At a latter time dont forget to dispatch
///     dispatch(DataLoadedAction(data: data))
///   }
/// }
///
/// store.dispatch(action: action)
/// ```

/// Async Middleware handles actions of type `AsyncAction`
///
/// `AsyncAction` are not dispatched to the reducer
/// When `AsyncMiddleware` intercepts an `AsyncAction` it does the following:
/// 1. Call `action.execute` on that action
/// 2. the action `executionBlock` is executed which receives the `dispatch` function as its sole parameter
/// 3. the `executionBlock` calls dispatch as many times as wanted, dispatching new actions (can also disptach new `AsyncAction`)
