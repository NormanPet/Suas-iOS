/// Store that contains the application single state, the reducer logic, the middleware and the listeners
///
/// The store contains four components
/// - **state**: represents the application state. This state is partitioned into state keys. Each key can represents a full application screen, flow, component, or view controller.
/// - **reducer** represents the logic to update the state. A reducer mainly provides a function that updates the state for a paticular action.
/// - **middleware**: an object (or list of objects) that intercept an action and can enrich or alter it before finally dispatching it to the reducer.
/// - **listener**: a function that gets called when a state is changed.
