/// Async action this type of action is intercepted by `AsyncMiddleware` and is not dispatched to the reducer
///
/// Recepie to use `AsyncAction`
/// 1. Create an `AsyncAction` action
/// 2. In the block passed at init. Perform any operation (dispatching it on your queue)
/// 3. When result is ready, call `dispatch` passing a new action
/// --------
/// **Example:**
///
/// Performing an async loading from disk
///
/// ```
/// let action = AsyncAction { api in
///   DispatchQueue(label: "MyQueue").async {
///     // Load from disk
///     // Process loaded
///     // Do more work
///
///     // Maybe consult the current state
///     let currentState = api.state
///
///     // At a latter time dont forget to dispatch
///     dispatch(DataLoadedAction(data: data))
///   }
/// }
///
/// store.dispatch(action: action)
/// ```
