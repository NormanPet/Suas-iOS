/// - Logging that is called before and after the dispatcher is called
/// - Perform network calls and dispatching an action representing the result when the network returns

/// **Example**
///
/// Logging middleware
///
/// ```
/// class LoggerMiddleware: Middleware {
///   var api: MiddlewareAPI?
///   var next: DispatchFunction?
///
///   func onAction(action: Action) {
///     print("The old state is \(api?.state)")
///     print("The action is \(action)")
///     next?(action)
///     print("The new state is \(api?.state)")
///   }
/// }
